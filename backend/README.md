DocPilot AI Organizer is a powerful desktop application built with Electron, designed to revolutionize your file management. Leveraging the power of local Artificial Intelligence (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)), DocPilot intelligently analyzes your file content, categorizes it, and suggests descriptive new names â€” helping you maintain an organized and efficient digital workspace.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Intelligent File Categorization:** DocPilot uses a local AI model to read the content of your files and automatically categorize them into logical groups (e.g., Business, Code, Documents, Financial, Personal, etc.).
* **AI-Powered Renaming Suggestions:** Get smart, concise, and descriptive new file names based on the actual content, making it easier to find what you need later.
* **Offline Functionality:** Since all AI processing happens locally via Ollama, DocPilot operates entirely offline, ensuring privacy and speed.
* **Directory Management:** Easily select, monitor, and organize files within specified directories.
* **Scheduled Organization:** Set up recurring tasks to keep your folders tidy automatically.
* **Activity Log:** Track all organization actions, renames, and moves for full transparency.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean, responsive Electron-based interface designed for ease of use.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get DocPilot up and running, you'll need Node.js (for Electron) and Python (for the backend). You'll also need the [Ollama server](https://ollama.com/download) installed. DocPilot will automatically pull the **Phi-3 Mini** model on first run, so no manual setup is required.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js & npm:** [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (npm is included).
* **Python 3.8+:** [Download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **Ollama Server:** [Download and install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) for your operating system.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DocPilot.git
    cd DocPilot
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Python):**
    Navigate into the `backend` directory, set up a virtual environment, install dependencies, and build the executable.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Build the Python backend into an executable with PyInstaller:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller docpilot_backend.spec
    ```

    After this step, you should have a `backend_dist` folder inside your `backend` directory, containing the `docpilot_backend` executable (or `docpilot_backend.exe` on Windows).

3.  **Frontend Setup (Electron):**
    Navigate back to the project root and install Node.js dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd .. # Go back to the DocPilot root directory
    npm install
    ```

### Running in Development Mode

Start both the Electron frontend and the backend:

```bash
npm start
